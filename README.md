# Social Media Theme Switcher Website

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will build a **Social Media Theme Switcher** using React. This project demonstrates how to implement light and dark themes in a React application, making it ideal for users who want to toggle between different styles for improved user experience and accessibility.

## Project Overview

This theme switcher project allows users to toggle between light and dark themes on a social media-like interface. The application switches the colors of the entire user interface, including the background, text, and button colors, based on the selected theme.

## Features

- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes to suit user preferences.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the layout adjusts smoothly across different devices.
- **Persist Theme**: The chosen theme is saved to `localStorage`, allowing users to maintain their preferred theme across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and handling the theme switch functionality.
- **CSS**: For styling the different themes and ensuring a responsive design.
- **localStorage**: To persist the theme selection across sessions.
